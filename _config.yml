author_bio: |-
  I have to make a confession. I am a nerd. And I love every second of it.  

  I am a huge Marvel fan. I love everything Anime and Manga. In the little free time I have, I play board games that are the closest thing you can find to actual roleplaying games. But most of all I am a software developer.

  Although it did not start that way. In the beginning I studied electrical engineering and there was only one module, one semester with one hour each week about OOP. But it was enough to get me hooked. After my studies I started as a software developer in C# where I honed my skills for 10 years.

  But I never stopped learning.

  Starting as hobby projects and later more professional as hackathons I fell in love with Web 3.0, which means full stack web development, including blockchain development. I literally learned the whole web stack during a hackathon which I miraculously even won in the end.

  Remember that I am a Marvel fan? My superpowers are: Incredible speed of understanding problems, architecture, new programming languages, everything that interests me; an unstoppable drive to improve myself and learn new things.

  My mission is to have fun and to enjoy every moment of my nerdy, chaotic (I do have three children) and adventurous life.
